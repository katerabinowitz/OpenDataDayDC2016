Visualizing DC's Open Data Presentation in PDF

Res_Permits1216_DemoData is data I will interactively demo with. I created this data from January 2012-January 2016 building permit data from here: http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=building+permits&sort_by=relevance. 
I've subset the data to new residential building permits only and did text analysis on the permit description field. The code to create this dataset can be found here: https://github.com/katerabinowitz/Construction_DC

DC_Vehicular_Crash_3_2015subset is data everyone will workshop with. It is a subset of DC's vehicular crash data for March 2015, the full file can be found here: http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/95254fae17bc4792bd47b53f71c2e503_19
